# Dynaverse

## Overview

**Dynaverse** is a C++-based RPG simulation prototype built as a proof-of-concept for the Realm Shaper class, part of the fictional H.U.SLAND game. It combines two tree structures: a **custom binary tree** (Shaper Tree) for ranking players, and a **self-balancing AVL tree** (World Tree) for representing the dynamic game world.

This simulation features player duels, territory access mechanics, item collection, realm crafting, and real-time updates through file and terminal output.
